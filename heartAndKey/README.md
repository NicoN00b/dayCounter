## Description

_{Heart and Key aims to solve the myriad of problems with current dating applications and sites.  Heart and Key gives users ownership of their data and will never sell it.  Heart and Key uses Blockstack's rigorous social identification system to make it harder bots, catfish, and stalkers to proliferate in the community.  The Blockstack social level determines whether a user can participate in Heart and Key and each Blockstack account can only have one Heart and Key Profile.  Users have a right to an alias within Heart and Key, but the Admins will be able to connect it back to a Blockstack profile if necessary.}_
